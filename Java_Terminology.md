# A collection of Java terminology  

- Method: It is a collection of statements that performs an operation. We'll be using a special method
called the main method that Java looks for when running a program. It is the entry point of any Java code. 

- Code block: A code block is used to define a block of code. It is mandatory to have one in a method declaration and it is here where we will be adding statements to perform certain tasks. 

- Statement: A complete command to be executed and can include one or more expressions. 

- Variables: Are a way to store information in our computer. Variables that we define in a program can be accessed by a name we give them, and the computers does the hard work of figuring out where they get stored in the RAM. There are lots of different types of data we can define for our variables known as Data types. 

- Declaration statement: Used to define a variable by indicating the data type, and the name, and optionally to set the variable to a certain value. 

- Expression: A construct that evaluates to a single value 

- Primitive types: Most basic data types. The 8 primitive data types are: Boolean, byte, char, short, int, long float and double. 

- Package: Is a way to organize a Java project. Use domain names as reserved. 

- Wrapper class: Java uses Wrapper class for all 8 primitive type. 

- Each primitive type occupies a different amount of memory 
 - Byte: 8 bits
 - short: 16 bits
 - int: 32 bits 

- Casting: Means to treat or convert a number from one type to another. We put the type we want the number to be in parenthesis as (byte) (myMinByteValue /2); for instance. 

- Precision: refers to the format and amount of space occupied by the type. Single precision occupies 32 bits (so the width of 32) and a Double precision occupies 64 bits (width of 64)

- Char: Similar to string i.e. it can store a character but can only store 1 character. Used where is used it asked to press one key, last key strokeâ€¦ A char occupies two bytes of memory, or 16 bits and thus has a width of 16. It is NOT as single byte because it allows us to store Unicode characters. 

- Boolean: In Java terms, we can have a Boolean primitive type and it can be set to two values only, true or false. 

- String: Is a sequence of characters. Is a datatype, which is not a primitive type. It is actually a class. 
  - Strings in Java are immutable. Meaning that you cannot change a String after it is created instaead a new String is created if you delete characters out of a String. 

- Operators: Are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result. Addition, Sub, Multi, Div are examples.

- Operand: Is a term used to describe any object that is manipulated by an operator. If we consider this statement **intmyVar = 15+12;** then **15** and **12** are operands. Variables used instead of literals are also operands. So, **double mySalary = hoursWorked * houralyRate;**  then  **hoursWorked** and **houralyRate;** are also operands. 

- Expression: Is formed by combining variables, literals, method return values and operators. 

- Code block: Allows more than one statement to be exectuted- a block of code. **{ \\write code }**
